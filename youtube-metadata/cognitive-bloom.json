  "title": "Cognitive Bloom - 25 Min Deep Focus Music | Pravos Focus Sessions",
  "description": "Experience Cognitive Bloom - a 25-minute instrumental journey designed for deep work and focused attention.\n\nI built Pravos (www.pravos.xyz) because I was tired of fragmented focus tools. Spotify for music. A timer app. A to-do list. Multiple tabs, constant context-switching, momentum lost before I even started working.\n\nSo I created a simple workspace that combines three things: a Pomodoro timer, a quick task list, and original instrumental focus music - all in one quiet interface.\n\nEach album follows the arc of an ecstatic dance practice: grounding, rising, peak expression, then a soft return. Just enough shape to carry you through a focus session, never enough to distract you.\n\nTry Pravos: www.pravos.xyz\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nABOUT THE MUSIC\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n25-minute instrumental focus sessions\nDesigned for deep work, coding, writing, and creative flow\nNo lyrics, no distractions - just continuous focus\n\n#focusmusic #deepwork #productivity #pravos #pomodoro #studymusic #codingmusic #ambientmusic #instrumentalmusic",
