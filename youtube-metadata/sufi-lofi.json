  "description": "Experience Sufi Lofi - a 25-minute spiritual lofi journey designed for deep focus and contemplative work.\n\nPravos (www.pravos.xyz) was born from frustration with fragmented focus tools. I wanted one clean workspace that supported deep work without demanding attention. Music, timer, tasks - unified and quiet.\n\nThis album blends Sufi-inspired melodies with lofi beats. The same intentional arc as all Pravos music: settling, building, sustaining, releasing.\n\nTry Pravos: www.pravos.xyz\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nABOUT THE MUSIC\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n25-minute instrumental focus sessions\nSufi-inspired lofi beats for contemplative work\nPerfect for writing, reflection, and creative flow\n\n#lofimusic #sufimusic #focusmusic #deepwork #pravos #spiritualmusic #concentrationmusic #meditativemusic",
