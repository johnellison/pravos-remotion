  "description": "Experience Deep Piano Focus - a 25-minute piano-driven journey designed for focused attention and creative work.\n\nPart of Pravos (www.pravos.xyz), the focus workspace I built to solve my own productivity fragmentation. No more juggling Spotify, a timer app, and a separate to-do list. Just one clean interface for deep work.\n\nEach album follows a deliberate arc: grounding, building, peaking, releasing. It's inspired by ecstatic dance - enough structure to support your focus, never enough to distract from the work.\n\nTry Pravos: www.pravos.xyz\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nABOUT THE MUSIC\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n25-minute instrumental focus sessions\nPiano-led compositions for deep concentration\nDesigned for writing, coding, studying, and creative flow\n\n#pianomusic #focusmusic #deepwork #productivity #pravos #studymusic #instrumentalmusic #concentrationmusic",
