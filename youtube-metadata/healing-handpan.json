  "description": "Experience Healing Handpan - a 25-minute handpan journey designed for deep focus and restorative work.\n\nI built Pravos (www.pravos.xyz) to bring flow into work. The kind of unbroken attention I experienced in meditation and yoga, but applied to coding, writing, and creative work.\n\nThis album features the hypnotic, healing tones of handpan drums. It follows the same intentional arc as all Pravos music - grounding, rising, sustaining, returning - but with a particularly meditative quality.\n\nTry Pravos: www.pravos.xyz\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nABOUT THE MUSIC\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n25-minute instrumental focus sessions\nHandpan drum compositions for deep, restorative focus\nPerfect for writing, meditation, and creative flow\n\n#handpanmusic #healingmusic #focusmusic #deepwork #pravos #meditationmusic #ambientmusic #flowstate",
