  "title": "Neural Drift - 25 Min Ambient Focus Music | Pravos Deep Work Sessions",
  "description": "Experience Neural Drift - a 25-minute ambient journey designed for deep concentration and creative flow.\n\nThis is part of Pravos (www.pravos.xyz), a minimalist focus workspace I built after years of juggling separate apps for music, timers, and task lists. One clean interface. One purpose: helping you sink into deep work.\n\nEach Pravos album is a 25-minute arc: gentle settling, rising focus, sustained peak, soft landing. The pattern mirrors ecstatic dance practice - enough movement to carry you, never enough to pull your attention.\n\nTry Pravos: www.pravos.xyz\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nABOUT THE MUSIC\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n25-minute instrumental focus sessions\nDesigned for deep work, coding, writing, and creative flow\nNo lyrics, no distractions - just continuous focus\n\n#focusmusic #ambientmusic #deepwork #productivity #pravos #studymusic #concentrationmusic #flowstate",
