# YouTube Titles & Descriptions for Pravos Albums

## 1. Cognitive Bloom

**Title:** Cognitive Bloom - 25 Min Deep Focus Music | Pravos Focus Sessions

**Description:**
Experience Cognitive Bloom - a 25-minute instrumental journey designed for deep work and focused attention.

I built Pravos (www.pravos.xyz) because I was tired of fragmented focus tools. Spotify for music. A timer app. A to-do list. Multiple tabs, constant context-switching, momentum lost before I even started working.

So I created a simple workspace that combines three things: a Pomodoro timer, a quick task list, and original instrumental focus music - all in one quiet interface.

Each album follows the arc of an ecstatic dance practice: grounding, rising, peak expression, then a soft return. Just enough shape to carry you through a focus session, never enough to distract you.

## 2. Neural Drift

**Title:** Neural Drift - 25 Min Ambient Focus Music | Pravos Deep Work Sessions

**Description:**
Experience Neural Drift - a 25-minute ambient journey designed for deep concentration and creative flow.

This is part of Pravos (www.pravos.xyz), a minimalist focus workspace I built after years of juggling separate apps for music, timers, and task lists. One clean interface. One purpose: helping you sink into deep work.

Each Pravos album is a 25-minute arc: gentle settling, rising focus, sustained peak, soft landing. The pattern mirrors ecstatic dance practice - enough movement to carry you, never enough to pull your attention.
