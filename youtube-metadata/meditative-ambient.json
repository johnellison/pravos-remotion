  "description": "Experience Meditative Ambient - a 25-minute calming soundscape designed for deep focus and mindful work.\n\nI built Pravos (www.pravos.xyz) to bring the flow state from meditation into my work. After years of context-switching between music apps, timers, and task lists, I wanted one simple workspace that just... works.\n\nThe music follows the arc of breath in meditation: settling, deepening, holding, releasing. 25 minutes of unbroken focus. No lyrics. No distraction. Just continuous flow.\n\nTry Pravos: www.pravos.xyz\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nABOUT THE MUSIC\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n25-minute instrumental focus sessions\nCalming ambient soundscapes for deep concentration\nInspired by meditation and mindful breathing\n\n#ambientmusic #meditationmusic #focusmusic #deepwork #pravos #calmmusic #concentrationmusic #mindfulness",
